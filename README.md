# Final Challenge Project

As the final part of my scholarship challenge, I built an image classifier from scratch that will identify different species of flowers.

## The Dataset

The data set contains images of flowers from 102 different species. Therefore, Udacity and Facebook provided a training set and a validation set that you can [download the images from here](https://s3.amazonaws.com/content.udacity-data.com/courses/nd188/flower_data.zip) as a zipped archive. Just uncompress it and you should be good to go.

## Project Notebook

In the project notebook an image classifier to recognize different species of flowers is trained and optimised. You can imagine using something like this in a phone app that tells you the name of the flower your camera is looking at. In practice you'd train this classifier, then export it for use in your application. 

The project is broken down into multiple steps:

- Load and preprocess the image dataset
- Train the image classifier on the given dataset
- Use the trained classifier to predict image content

## Performance and Accuracy

The Validation accuracy was about 98%.
